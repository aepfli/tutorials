# Keptn on OpenShift with Code Ready Containers

## Welcome
Duration: 2:00 

In this tutorial you'll get a full tour on how to run Keptn on Code Ready Containers. 
[Code Ready Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) gets you up and running with an OpenShift cluster on your local machine in minutes.

Special thanks to [Marc Chisinevski](https://github.com/marcredhat) who built the technical foundation for this tutorial that made it possible for us to provide this tutorial. Checkout [his original instructions in his Github repository](https://github.com/marcredhat/crcdemos/tree/master/keptn).

### What you'll learn

- How to install CodeReady containers on your local machine
- How to install Keptn on this platform
- How to set up a multi-stage delivery pipeline with Keptn
- How to set up quality gates based on service-level objectives
- How to enable auto-remediation with Keptn and Unleash


## Prerequisites & Resources
Duration: 5:00

Please note that some prerequisites have to be met to run through this tutorial.

Locally installed tooling:
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/)
- a recent version of [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)


We have provided some helper scripts and files for you to make the tutorial more frictionless.

Download the resources for this tutorial via git:
```
git clone --branch release-0.1.0 https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/openshift-crc-tutorial

cd openshift-crc-tutorial/resources
```


## Get Code Ready Containers
Duration: 10:00

For running [Code Ready Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) a machine with **at least 16 GB of RAM** is recommended.

1. Download CRC from this website into the current folder that we have created inthe previous step: [https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/download](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/download)
There are versions available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. This tutorial has been tested on [version 1.17.0](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/crc/1.17.0/) and the instructions here are for the Mac/Linux version.

1. Copy your pull secret to the current folder in a file called `pull-secret.txt`.

## Install CodeReady Containers
Duration: 10:00

1. Define the CodeReady Container version and your operating system - please adjust those variables to fit your environment! Execute these commands depending on your environment. Please note that the `CRCVERSION` might slightly change - we try to keep the tutorial up-to-date but it might run a bit behind. (Pro-tip: you can always [raise a PR](https://github.com/keptn/tutorials) to help us keep our tutorials up-to-date.)
  ```
  export OS=macos
  export CRCVERSION=1.17.0
  ```
  For Linux that might look like this.

  ```
  export OS=linux
  export CRCVERSION=1.17.0
  ```

1. Edit `crc.sh` if you want to configure the memory and CPU cores available to CodeReady Containers.

1. Execute the setup script
  ```
  ./crc.sh
  ```
  **Please note the setup might take a couple of minutes!**

1. Once finished, the script will provide you with some output:

  ```
  This will install OpenShift 4.5, display the login info and open a browser window with the OpenShift console.
  INFO To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions
  INFO Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'
  INFO To login as an admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p yourpassword https://api.crc.testing:6443'
  INFO
  INFO You can now run 'crc console' and use these credentials to access the OpenShift web console
  Started the OpenShift cluster
  WARN The cluster might report a degraded or error state. This is expected since several operators have been disabled to lower the resource usage. For more information, please consult the documentation
  Opening the OpenShift Web Console in the default browser...
  ```

1. From the previous output, we still need to execute some commands. To access the cluster, first set up your environment by **following 'crc oc-env' instructions**.

  ```
  crc oc-env
  ```

Negative
: Please follow the instructions that are given from the `crc oc-env` command before proceeding.

Next, login as an `admin` with the command that from the log output above. Please make sure to *use the correct password that you see on your own screen*.

  ```
  oc login -u kubeadmin -p yourpassword https://api.crc.testing:6443
  ```

Negative
: Depending on your machine, it might take a while (3-5 minutes) for CRC to be ready and to accept your login request. Please be patient. 

### Other options to run CodeReady Containers

If you want to run it on a different environment than you local machine, check out these additional resources.

1. If you want to run it on a VM in GCP, please make sure nested virtualization is enabled. [Follow this official guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances) if not yet enabled.


## Install OpenShift service mesh
Duration: 5:00

Now we are going to install the OpenShift service mesh that is needed for our tutorial into the CRC cluster.

The script that is provided will create the following resources:

- Install Kiali, Jaeger and Service Mesh Operators
- Deploy the Service Mesh control plane in istio-system.
- Create the Service Mesh member roll.

1. Execute the script:

```
./mesh.sh 
```

1. Verify that all pod in the `istio-namespace` are running (might take a while).
  ```
  oc get pods -n istio-system
  ```
  You should see a similar result:
  ```

## Install Keptn

Let us know install Keptn on our local OpenShift/CRC cluster.

1. Download the Keptn CLI:
  ```
  curl -sL https://get.keptn.sh | sudo -E bash
  ```
1. Install Keptn into the cluster via the CLI:
  ```
  keptn install --use-case=continuous-delivery --platform=openshift
  ```
  Provide the needed values you will be asked during the installation.
  ```
  Openshift Server URL []: https://api.crc.testing:6443
  Openshift User []: kubeadmin
  Openshift Password []: *****
  ```

1. Set your local `oc` CLI to to the right project.
  ```
  oc project keptn
  ```

1. Expose the API endpoint of Keptn to be able to connect to it.

  ```
  oc expose svc api-gateway-nginx
  ``` 

1. Now let's connect the Keptn CLI to the Keptn installation.

  ```
  export KEPTN_ENDPOINT=http://api-gateway-nginx-keptn.apps-crc.testing/api
  export KEPTN_API_TOKEN=$(oc get secret keptn-api-token -n keptn -ojsonpath={.data.keptn-api-token} | base64 --decode)
  
  keptn auth --endpoint=$KEPTN_ENDPOINT --api-token=$KEPTN_API_TOKEN
  ```

1. Get the credentials for the bridge

  ```
  keptn configure bridge --output
  ```

1. Now go ahead and open a browser to login under the following URL:  [http://api-gateway-nginx-keptn.apps-crc.testing/bridge](http://api-gateway-nginx-keptn.apps-crc.testing/bridge)
